The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have invaded your ship and destroyed
your entire crew. You are the last surviving member (oh noes!) and your
last mission is to get the neutron destruct bomb from the Weapons Armory,
put it in the bridge, and blow up the ship after getting into and escape pod.

You're now running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when a
Gothon hops out in an evil clown costume filled with hate. He's blocking the door
to the Armory and about to pull a weapon to blast you.

The Gothon bursts into laughter and rolls around on the ground. While its
laughting you run up and use your copy of Nietzsche's notebooks (translated into Gothon)
to lecture the Gothon on the shaky foundations of its ideologies. While it tries
to cope with its existential crisis, you leap through the Weapon Armory door.

You dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room for more Gothons
that might be hiding. It's dead quiet, too quiet.
You stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the neutron bomb in its
container. There's a keypad lock on the box and you need the code to get the bomb
out. If you get the code wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever and you can't
get the bomb. The code is 3 digits.

can't get out. Now that the bomb is placed you run to the escape pod.

You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to the escape pod. It seems
like there's no Gothons around, so you run as fast as possible. Eventually ou reach
